* Illustration on Google Maps. How do people from Sweden speak to people from Sri Lanka?
* [Advice Slip](https://adviceslip.com/) and [API](https://api.adviceslip.com/#endpoint-random). If they have machines that run on the programming language RUST, how can we communicate with them? They serialize their data to JSON!
* Douglass Crawford

* Recursion (basic example)
* Example function
